* Shapley Flow

  This repository contains implementation for the AISTATS 2021 paper 
  "[[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14592.pdf][Shapley Flow: A Graph-based Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions]]".
  
  The directory is organized as the following. Files in the current directory
  include implementations of the algorithm and baselines.

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  flow.py: Implementation of the Shapley Flow algorithm
  on_manifold.py: Implementation of the on-manifold SHAP baseline
  linear_evaluation.py: Evaluation code for paper Section 4.3
  #+END_VERSE

  ~notebooks/~ contains case studies and experiments for the paper
