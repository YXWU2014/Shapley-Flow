  Shapley value flow
  
  Sample experiments in [[./flow_synthetic_experiments.ipynb][notebook]]

** versions

   version 0: once a node's value is changed, make it visible to the output

   version 1: only expose a node's new value if the edge to the target is
   opened. This requires each node to keep track of its argument's value.
   Difference from version 0 is in dfs part.

** installation instructions

   We require the master version of the package shap placed in the directory to
   run the notebooks.

   There has been issues installing pygraphviz. First make sure graphviz is
   installed.  Then make sure you installed python-dev for the specific python
   version you are using:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   apt-get install pythonX.X-dev # e.g python3.8-dev; I'm using python3.8
   #+END_SRC

   Then one should be able to install pygraphviz with

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   pip install pygraphviz # or "pip install --install-option="--include-path=/usr/local/include/" --install-option="--library-path=/usr/local/lib/" pygraphviz" as noted in https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz/issues/100
   #+END_SRC
   
** sanity check graphs

   The [[./sanity_check_graphs.ipynb][notebook]] contains sanity check graphs for various flow approaches.

** python version

   requires python3.8.2

   requirements are listed in requirements.txt

** development notes

   1. schools server: mld3 seems very slow to run xgboost models, but
      explanation seems to run fine. This is not a huge issue but worth
      investigating why.
