  Shapley value flow
  
  Sample experiments in [[./flow_synthetic_experiments.ipynb][notebook]]

** versions

   version 0: once a node's value is changed, make it visible to the output

   version 1: only expose a node's new value if the edge to the target is
   opened. This requires each node to keep track of its argument's value.
   Difference from version 0 is in dfs part.

** sanity check graphs

   The [[./sanity_check_graphs.ipynb][notebook]] contains sanity check graphs for various flow approaches.
